# VIPRespawns
Sourcemod plugin for CS:GO. Allowing players with A-flag respawn x times per map!

## Usage
Players with the `a`-flag gets (per default) 3 respawns per map.  
To respawn, you simply use the command `!vipspawn` when dead.  
You can also check how many respawns you have left via `!spawnsleft`.

## Installation

Then execute command in server console:

## Configuration
The config-file is located in `root/csgo/cfg/sourcemod/viprespawns.cfg`. In there you can change some options. For now, you can only change the amount of respawns per map is allowed.

This is how the config looks like:

// Amount of times a user is allowed to respawn per map
// -
// Default: "3"
respawn_amount "3"

// Users with this flag are allowed to use the respawn command.
// Correct flagnames needs to be used: http://bit.ly/2rkYezB

// Default: "ADMFLAG_RESERVATION"
respawn_flag "ADMFLAG_RESERVATION"
```


### Credits
Props to [B2SX](https://forums.alliedmods.net/member.php?u=265974) for creating the base-code for respawns!  
What I did was clean the code a bit and added some more end-user friendly properties.
